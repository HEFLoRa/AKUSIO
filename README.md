## 3)	Hardware:
   ### a.	Components
The main components of Shazam are shown in figure 1, RPI3B with Raspberry Pi OS Lite system, using the lite system instead of the desktop version to decrease CPU consumption, a StromPi3 is used as a power management board that allows scheduled shut down and start up of the system, a 4-Mic array that records bird voices, a LoRa HAT to transmit the data to a LoRa server (The Things Network) and a INA219 breakout board to monitor the current generated by solar panels.

   ### b.	Setup
The StromPi HAT can be directly connected on the RPI, but the ReSpeaker and the LoRa HAT must be manually connected as shown in figure 2, just follow the color code for each RPi pin and use a breadboard for the common pins between the ReSpeaker and the LoRa HAT (Pin 12).

## 4)	Power Consumption
A power monitoring system was developed using INA219 breakout board and RPI. This system is also used to monitor the solar energy input from the solar panels which will be discussed in the Solar Energy section.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64909238/121410698-25ea7600-c963-11eb-815c-4b914d28c62c.png)

Power consumption of the system was tested under different conditions:
    		  
         Default IDLE consumption:	
            - Average Current (mA): 222.40
            - Average Voltage (V): 5.20
            - Average Power (W): 1.16
           
         Power consumption during running the Shazam while turning off USB, LAN, HDMI, LEDs and BT:
            - Average Current (mA): 272.29
            - Average Voltage (V): 5.19
            - Average Power (W): 1.41
              
Effect of turning off different peripherals of RPi:


This test was done on RPI 3B+. First, default current consumption was measured, and it was 456.4 mA, then each peripheral was turned off separately and the current consumption for each peripheral turned off and the numbers shown are the new consumption after turning off each peripheral subtracted from the default consumption.

## 5)	Solar Energy to Power Shazam
The solar energy system shown in figure 5 was designed to power the RPi. For the power boost we used the Adafruit PowerBoost 500 Charger - Rechargeable 5V Lipo USB Boost @ 500mA+ and a common 3-leg voltage regulator.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64909238/121412514-166c2c80-c965-11eb-957f-dd91ee76c0c7.png)

	Average Current Consumption: 300 mA
	Solar Panels: 2 x 17 V / 10 W
	Surface Area = 0.116 m² 
	Efficiency = 17 %
	Average daily power output for 12 sunny hours: 20(W) * 0.17 * 12(h) = 40.8 Wh
	Average daily current output = 2400 mAh
	Li-ion Battery Capacity = 4800 mAh


## 6)	LoRa transmissions
An open source lmic based code is used to transmit data to a LoRa gateway, the code can be found in this link: https://github.com/wklenk/lmic-rpi-lora-gps-hat , WiringPi library have to be installed first, then the LoRa file can run. 
Our LoRa transmission algorithm basically reads the json data file that is created by the main bird sound detection algorithm, for each data entry, the highest 3 probabilities are read, in addition to the timestamp data and the current readings from the INA219, then if the highest bird id probability is higher than 0.2, the data is transmitted over LoRa using the LoRaWAN HAT to TTN, otherwise the data entry is skipped and the algorithm checks the next one. The whole process is showed in figure 8 and the python file responsible for it is lora.py file.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64909238/121415580-30f3d500-c968-11eb-8ace-9ec6826b1ec5.png)


## 7)	Power management
Since Raspberry Pi does not have a built-in power management system, an external power management system is used to schedule the working hours of the detection system to reduce the overall power consumption during the times when there is no bird activity expected. 
We use the StromPi 3 power management board since it has the specs and capabilities we need for our system, the WakeUp-Alarm mode starts the RPi at a predefined time, while the PowerOff-Alarm mode shuts down the RPi at a predefined time.
Preparing the scheduled shutdown and power up:
	
	a. Set the real time clock (RTC) by synchronizing it with the RPi time.
	b. Set the PowerOff-Alarm mode to shutdown the RPi everyday at a certain time.
	c. Set WakeUp-Alarm mode at alarm mode 1 to start the RPi everyday at a certain time.
	d. Activate Power save mode to reduce StromPi power consumption.
	e. Activate serialless mode to allow other HATs to use serial connection with RPi.
	
	
## 8)	Running shazam
To run shazam after the complete installation of the system, simply run the "shazam.py" file and it will take care of the whole process as shown in the process flowchart.

Shazam.py works as follows:

		1. Runs the main.py file responsible for bird voice detection
		2. main.py file detects any surrounding voices and writes a report of each detection in a json file (/bird_data/data_n.json)
		3. After 30 minutes it runs lora.py file which access the json files, checks each detection if there is a high probability (higher than 0.2) of a certain bird then transmit the data over LoRa using the LoRa HAT

Files locations:

	"main.py": "/Shazam4Nature-master-3/pi_main/"
	"lora.py": "/Shazam4Nature-master-3/pi_main/lmic-rpi-lora-gps-hat/examples/periodic"

## 9)	Imortant files and directories

	- Shazam4Nature-master-3/pi_main/main.py : Main python file that includes the bird sound detection algorithm using ReSpeaker 4-mic array.
	- Shazam4Nature-master-3/pi_main/mic_array.py : ReSpeaker 4-mic array based code for recording sound
	- Shazam4Nature-master-3/pi_main/recognition/recognition.py : Loads the CNN model and predicts the bird type
	- Shazam4Nature-master-3/pi_main/bird_data/ : Directory that keeps the bird sound recognition reports as json files
	- Shazam4Nature-master-3/pi_main/lmic-rpi-lora-gps-hat/examples/periodic/main.c : Main C file that controls the LoRa tranmission process, payload, keys and LoRa configuration must be editted in this file. We control the file using lora.py file, so no need to edit anything inside. The main.c file is compiled and creates an executable called periodic.out that must run to transmit the payload.
	- Shazam4Nature-master-3/pi_main/lmic-rpi-lora-gps-hat/examples/periodic/build/periodic.out : Executable that runs the LoRa process
	. Shazam4Nature-master-3/pi_main/lmic-rpi-lora-gps-hat/examples/periodic/lora.py : Python file that controls the LoRa tranmission process (main.c and periodic.out). It This file reads data from json files that include sound recognition reports and edit main.c accordingly before running periodic.out.
